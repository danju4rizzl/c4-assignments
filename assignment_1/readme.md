# Instructions

The `run()` function in the `src/main.rs` prints in the terminal whether an integer is an even number or an odd number given a range of numbers.
 
 It accepts two parameters of type `u32`:

 `start`: start value of range

 `limit`: end value of range
 
 ## Example:
 Given the following code snippet in `src/main.rs` file:
 
      fn main() {
          run(0, 10);
      }
 
 If the above snippet is executed by running `cargo run` in your terminal, you should see the following output:

      0 is an even number
      1 is an odd number
      2 is an even number
      3 is an odd number
              .
              .
              .
      9 is an odd number

# Todo
Implement the body of the `run()` function in `src/main.rs` file to be able to achieve the functionality described above.

Replace the following statement in the body of `run()` function with your implementation:

     todo!();
